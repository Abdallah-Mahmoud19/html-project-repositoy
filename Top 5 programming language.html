		<tr>
		  <td>Python</td>
		  <td>python is known to be comprehensive and can be used very well for various purposes. In the field of machine learning, this programming language contains libraries such as numpy and scipy, which enable your PC to learn linear algebra and kernel methods for machine learning. While dealing with machine learning algorithms, this language is widely used as it has a simple structure. It is the best amateur programming language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>R Programming</td>
		  <td>
			This programming language was produced in Bell Lab as an advanced model of the S language. In order to give adaptability in providing statistical models, the R language was combined with a lexical examination. Some GNU GNU packages make it a very surprising language for machine learning. One can use the R language to create valuable algorithms and a simple statistical visualization of these algorithms by using Studio R. The industry realized late on the importance of the R language even though it was the trend of scientific professionals long ago.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>JavaScript</td>
			<td>
				Currently most web developers, new or former, use JavaScript, this language has long been restricted in web development, but at this point, with Tensorflow.js, an open source library for Googleâ€™s machine learning system, the language can now be used In machine learning.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C # Sharp</td>
			<td>
				Data science is closely related to machine learning. If you are from the .NET and C # organization, you may want to use C # for machine learning.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Shell</td>
			<td>
				"Shell" shares Python as very simple, but not its power. However, due to its simplicity, it is among the best options as amateurs find it easy to use this language.</td>
